A android/iOS school social app created using AngularJS, Ionic framework, phonegap and firebase. It is not complete as development was stopped but can be studied (though some of it Spaghetti code)

To make it usable you need to replace https//rabbitapp.firebaseio.com in the app.js file with your own firebase path.
